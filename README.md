# Reactive Portfolio
[Sample Site](https://madcerto.github.io/rxportfolio/)

This is a website template for a simple photo portfolio, built in ReactJS
using Vite and vite-imagetools. It can be hosted on GitHub Pages, or on
any static webserver. A little bit of technical knowledge is helpful,
but setup is quite simple. Epic.

## Dependencies (for self-hosting)
- A OS compatible with the [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install#prebuilt-binaries)
library
- Node.js v20.x
- NPM v10.2.5+

## Building
```
npm install
npm run build
```
Output is in the `dist` folder

## Deploying
### Self-hosted
Serve the output files on any static web server. Make sure all
routes serve the index.html file.

### GitHub Pages
Fork the repo, using the same `rxportfolio` name. Currently this
has to be hardcoded; if you need to change the name, you can just go into
the code and replace all references to it. Create a new branch called
`deploy` from the main branch. This will trigger the build process to run.
It may take a few mins, but once a `gh-pages` branch is generated, you
can [set up GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart#creating-your-website)
to serve that branch.

## Configuration
The `albums` directory at the root of the project is scanned for
subdirectories that contain the displayed albums.
```
- /
  - albums
    - albumfolder1
      - img1.jgp
      - img2.jpg
    - albumfolder2
      - img1.jgp
      - img2.jpg
```
Any further subdirectories will not be scanned, so make sure all images
are directly inside their album. You can order the images by naming them in
ascending order.

Config options are in the `config.json` file:

### title
Title that appears at the top on the left
### description
Description that appears on the left. Optional.
### albums
List of albums to display. You can either give the name of the folder
that contains the album:
```
"albums": [
  "folder1",
  "folder2"
]
```
or an array with the first item being the display name of the album,
and the second being the folder name:
```
"albums": [
  ["Album 1", "folder1"],
  ["Album 2", "folder2"]
]
```
or a mix of both. The only folder name not allowed is `rxportfolio`.
If you must, you can use an alias to name an album that. The first
album in the list is the default, i.e. the root of the site redirects
to it.
### returnLink
Optional, if you want to put a link to your home page, or any other
page, at the end of the albums list.

Either link to the page itself:
```
"returnLink": "https://example.com"
```
which will show an item called "Return" on the page

or an array with the first element as the name of the item, and
the second as the link to the page:
```
"returnLink": ["Home", "https://example.com"]
```

## Known Issues
- capitalized file extensions can mess with it (e.g. img.JPG)
- rotating an image using EXIF flags rather than actually 
having a rotated image messes with the image processing library.
use a proper image editor to rotate images, and fix any current images
[using IrfanView](https://exiftool.org/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=02928edf530afe784db76d07de54677a&msg=59324)
or a different software
- special characters and spaces in file names may also mess with the image
processing library. avoid if possible
